# env

This repo is a set of dotfiles and tools I use in my everyday work as a JS dev.

Nothing is meant to be perfect, but it works for me.

# Typical machine

This has been tested on Mac OS X Mountain Lion, with zsh and oh-my-zsh preinstalled.
Nothing is guaranteed to work on your machine.

## Install script

There's a (shamefully) basic install script. In fact, less than an install script,
it should be considered as a reminder of the steps to obtain a functional environment.
I wouldn't be surprised if it failed at any step.
